        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This application visualize kd-tree data structure.
            You can generate some points, create kd-tree using them and perform range query.
            Both creation and querying the tree can be done step by step
            to help you learn the idea behind this structure.
        </p>
        <h2>Points generation</h2>
        <p>
            First start with decision how many points you want to generate.
            Application can handle easily even more than 300 points
            but if you want to understand idea behind the kd-tree and use step-by-step mode
            you'd better select 20-30 points. Click the "Regenerate points" button to proceed. <br />
            <img src="images/generation.png" alt="Generated points" class="screenshot"/>
        </p>
        <h2>KD-tree creation</h2>
        <p>
            Now you can create kd-tree. You can either simply click on "Generate kd-tree" button
            and you'll see generated tree like this: <br />
            <img src="images/kd-tree.png" alt="KD-tree creation" class="screenshot"/>
            If you want to deeply understand the idea and tree creation algorithm
            check "step by step?" checkbox placed just next to the number points selector and
            click "Generate kd-tree" button one more time. You'll see some new controls enabling you
            to iterate forward and backward through algorithm steps, giving you detailed description
            of each step and visualizing current step. Inside buttons change current step by one,
            outside ones rewinds it to the start or forwards to the end. Click on the "Finish" button
            in order to close step by step mode. <br />
            <img src="images/kd-tree-step-by-step.png" alt="KD-tree creation step by step" class="screenshot"/>
        </p>
        <h2>Range querying</h2>
        <p>
            When you have your tree generated you can perform range query using it.
            Start with clicking "Perform search" button which is now enabled.
            You'll see a result of a sample query. Now you can select a new range with your mouse
            or move and change the size of the existing selection. When you are done with the selection
            click on the "Perform search" once again and you'll see the result.
            All points that were classified as "in the range" are marked with red color.
            All points that were taken into consideration during the query process but not selected
            are marked with yellow color. <br />
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/range-query.png" alt="Range query"/>
            Similarly as with creation, you can have the algorithm presented step by step
            if you check "step by step?" checkbox before clicking "Perform search". <br />
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/range-query-step-by-step.png" alt="Range query step by step"/>
        </p>
        <h2>Binary tree view</h2>
        <p>
            Besides the geometrical visualization characteristic to kd-tree application displays also
            binary tree visualization of the kd-tree instance in the application memory.
            Similarly to the geometrical view it updates also in the step by step mode.
            State of the nodes is denoted by their color:
            <ul>
                <li>White - not processed yet</li>
                <li>Gray - processed fully</li>
                <li>Green - leaf (contains a point)</li>
                <li>Yellow - checked but not in query range (only for leaves)</li>
                <li>Red - in a query range (only for leaves)</li>
                <li>Black - subtree is fully contained in a query range</li>
                <li>Blue - currently processed node (only step by step mode)</li>
            </ul>
            Moreover you can mouse over some nodes and you'll see the range on the plane
            that a node is responsible for. You can also collapse some nodes by clicking on them.
            Here is a binary tree visualized in the middle of kd-tree creation:<br />
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/binary-tree-creation.png" alt="Binary tree - kd-tree creation"/>
            And here is the tree after querying for a range: <br />
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/binary-tree-query.png" alt="Binary tree - querying"/>
